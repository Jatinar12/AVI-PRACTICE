        Science and technology are important parts of our day to day life.<br>
        We get up in the morning from the ringing of our alarm clocks and go to bed at night after switching our lights off. <br>
        All these luxuries that we are able to afford are a resultant of science and technology.<br>
        Most importantly, how we can do all this in a short time are because of the advancement of science and technology only.<br>
        It is hard to imagine our life now without science and technology. Indeed our existence itself depends on it now.<br>
        Every day new technologies are coming up which are making human life easier and more comfortable. <br>
        Thus, we live in an era of science and technology.
